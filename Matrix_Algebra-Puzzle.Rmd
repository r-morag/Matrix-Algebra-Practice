```

## Introduction

You will be asked to perform a series of calculations on a matrix of numbers.  If you follow all the steps successfully, your end result will be a matrix of pixel intensities for an image - that is, if you plot your matrix (I have supplied the code for that), you will see a black and white photograph.

## Setup 

Run the following code chunk to load up your matrix (M), and to generate some random matrices and vectors that we will use along the way.

```{r}
### DO NOT CHANGE ANYTHING IN THIS CODE CHUNK!!!

M = read.csv("img.txt", header = FALSE)
M = as.matrix(M)


n = nrow(M)
p = ncol(M)

set.seed(123)
A <- diag(rnorm(p))
set.seed(456)
B <- tcrossprod(as.matrix(array(rnorm(25), c(5,5))))
set.seed(789)
x <- abs(rnorm(p))
set.seed(101)
y <- rnorm(n)
set.seed(112)
H <- as.matrix(array(rnorm(n*p), c(n,p)))

```


## Your turn

Before you finalize your process, delete everything above "Your Turn", except for the setup code chunk, so that you are not duplicating steps 1 and 2.

Perform the following steps (we have already shown  1 and 2) to discover the secret picture!


1. Matrix-multiply M by A.

```{r}
M <- M %*% A

```

2. Multiply every row of M elementwise by x. 
```{r}

M <- t(M) * x
M <- t(M)
```

3. Make a diagonal matrix called Y whose diagonal values are the elements of the vector y.  Matrix-multiply the inverse of Y by M.

```{r}
Y <- diag(x = y)
InverseY <- solve(Y)

M <- Y %*% M
```

4.  Calculate the determinant of B.  Add this scalar to every element of M.
```{r}
detB <- det(B)

M <- M + detB
```

5. Use `eigen()` to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of B.  Find the sum of the third eigenvector of B. Multiply every element of M by this scalar.

```{r}
eigensB <- eigen(B)

sumeb <- sum(eigensB$vectors[,3])

M <- M * sumeb
```


6. Multiply each element of M by the corresponding element of the matrix formed by (xy')'.
```{r}
xy <- outer(x, y)
xy_transposed <- t(xy)

M <- M * xy_transposed
```

7. Find the singular value decomposition H = UDV' using `svd()`.  Multiply each element of M by each element of 100*U. 

```{r}
svd_result <- svd(H)

U <- svd_result$u

M <- M * (100 * U)
```

8. Calculate the sum of the singular values of H.  Divide *every* element of M by this scalar.

```{r}
sumH <- sum(svd_result$d)

M <- M / sumH

```

## The results

Run the following code to plot your result.  If it does not look like a real photographic image, something has gone wrong - go back and check your steps.

```{r}
image(M, col = gray((1:100)/100), asp = 1, axes = FALSE)
```
